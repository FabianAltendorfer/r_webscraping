# R_Webscraping Script

This r_webscraping script demonstrates the use of the R programming language to develop a web scraper that collects information from real estate listings on [willhaben.at](https://www.willhaben.at/iad), one of Austria's leading real estate marketplaces. I developed this script as a part of my Bachelor's thesis titled 'Alternative Datenquellen f√ºr das Controlling', aiming to explore unconventional data sources for financial controlling."

The script methodically extracts key data points for each property listed, facilitating a comprehensive data analysis. The information harvested includes the title of the listing, square meterage, the number of rooms, type of property, and the price. In addition, the script also gathers data on the location of the property, its key features, a detailed description, and additional information that could be of interest to potential buyers or investors.

By automating this process, the script enables efficient and structured data collection that would otherwise be manual and time-consuming. The data gathered could then be leveraged for further analysis in financial controlling or for market research purposes. Please note that it is important to obey the restrictions set by the website owner in the robots.txt-file. This particular script was used for reasearch purposes only.
